### Projects

#### Project 1 Title
 - In my Inventory Manager project, I created the business “Foot MARKet” as a small shoe retailing business. I used purchase price, retail price, and estimated profit to determine if the company needs to increase profit margin.

 - Coming up with this project wasn’t much of a challenge because shoes interest me. Luckily, excel is a very useful software and I didn’t need much help from another tool. I did however use other shoe retail websites to figure out a fair selling price for the products. The biggest challenge for my project was getting familiar with the commands for the IF statements. My problem was resolved after I got help from Mr. John. I wanted to achieve an understanding in being an Inventory Manager and essentially seeing what they see.

#### Project 2 Title
 - In this project I created a Personality Test using the Python language. This Personality test determines what king of person you are through a series of 10 questions.

 - This project was a little more challenging for me because its hard to remember how to order the code. I got assistance from some friends who have taken the class before and ended up understanding how to use it efficiently. I believe the questions are fair and it gives great feedback after completing the tesr. I wanted to challenge myself with this project so I can learn from my mistakes and understand the unit better.

#### Project 3 Title
 - For this project I took my shoe retail business up a notch and started selling more than shoes. With my social networking abilities, there are many known names purchasing my products.

 - My project keeps track of my customers and their purchases. I was introduced to Microsoft Access which I havent even heard of until recently. When I first booted up the software, I was lost so I started searching up Youtube videos on how to use it. After many attempts I somewhat understood what to do. This project helped me achieve a way of keeping track of exchanges, clientel, and customers.
